# Java-data-structures-n-algorithms

In this repository I post data structures and algorithm projects by adopting and adjusting some known cs algorithms for Java using custom data types.

Most of the test and all the tasks are written by Jaanus PÃ¶ial. I was a student of his course and solver of the tasks.
